# WLAN-Performance-Measurement-Tool-FinalYearProject
It meausres the performance of Wireless local area network by sniffing traffic and extracting the features from packets. By utilizing features, the implemented algorithm finds key performance indicators of Wireless local area network.
key performance indicators are as follow:

##Data Link Layer
a) Uplink Radio Retransmission Rate <br/>
b) Downlink Radio Retransmission Rate <br/>
c) Uplink Radio Frame Size <br/>
d) Downlink Radio Frame Size <br/>

##Network Layer:
a) ICMP Success Rate <br/>
b) Round Trip Time <br/>

##Transport layer:
a) Uplink throughput <br/>
b) Downlink throughput <br/>
c) Uplink TCP retransmission rate <br/>
d) Downlink TCP retransmission rate <br/>
